## Development

### Requirements

- [Volta](https://volta.sh) (used for managing Node.js and npm versions)

#### Installing Volta (if not already installed)

```bash
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
```

With Volta, the correct Node.js/npm version is automatically applied when you enter the project directory.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Volta and move into the repository root to automatically use the correct Node.js version.
3. Install dependencies.
    ```bash
    npm ci
    ```
4. Verify operation. If the server starts and you can view your work in the browser, you're all set!
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

### Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Build

```bash
npm run build
```
